  _shortDescription: Reactor Control
  _longDescription: A centralized control center equipped with a suite of improved
    monitoring, management, and control systems for a ship's reactor plant, allowing
    crew to operate remotely from the localized controls, for more efficient operation
    of the power plant. This variant requires a bit more space but is less fragile.
  _flavorText: 'All reactor bays have a lightweight version of these, but the actual
    PCC is far more specialized. Some of them are hooked up to an AN-2500 Superbrain
    and typically left to run in maximum efficiency settings to keep the warship
    powered during long deployments.


    You can''t go wrong with one of these,
    but the equipment is pretty delicate and despite constant complaints about monitors
    and control interfaces breaking down, the Naval Office doesn''t really want to
    drop the funds to fix a problem that can be handled by most DC teams. Unfortunate,
    but not unexpected.
