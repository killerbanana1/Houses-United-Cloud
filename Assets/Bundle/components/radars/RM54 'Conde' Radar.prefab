  _shortDescription: Multi-Function Radar
  _longDescription: The RM54 'Conde' is our attempt at replicating the highly coveted
    'Parallax' radar from Shelter. It succeeded in some areas, and fell short in
    others. It's range is a bit worse and difficulties with the technology forced
    it up in scale to a 3x3 module slot, but that does have it's perks. The extra
    space simplifies the construction, and allows for some thicker plates. Plus,
    our engineers found a way to build in a bit of jamming resistance. Overall, the
    project was a success. It's affordable, tuff, and multi-function. What more could
    you need?
  _flavorText: 'In the Republics brief 80+ year military partnership, the Alliance
    denied every single request to share the RM50 ''Parallax'' with us, along with
    most of their fancy toys, so we tasked our lab coats with making a version of
    our own. The project quickly discovered how much of a miracle of engineering
    the RM50 really is. Our attempts came close but they could never achieve all
    three goals at once. Something had to be sacrificed, and given the infamous money-pit
    it was for Shelter the academy elected to compromise with the most budget-friendly
    option. As a result the RM54 is too big to fit in the standardized 2x2 module
    slots, which was half the point of the damned thing. And to add insult to injury,
    the RM50 still has an entire kilometer over us. At least the academy knew when
    to call it quits. Probably saved the taxpayer billions.
