  _shortDescription: Damage Control
  _longDescription: This compartment is essentially a large storage closet for spare
    parts and damage control equipment. It does not contain facilities to equip any
    damage control personell, requiring dedicated damage control lockers with crew
    members to properly support a ship.
  _flavorText: "These storages were put in place of crew bunks as we began to refit
    our older vessels with more modern systems in an attempt to increase their survivability
    and endurance in the field. In that regard they have been startlingly effective,
    especially compared to the aformentioned \"modern systems.\" Its always useful
    to have an extra wrench set onboard, and an extra place to sequester away a bottle
    of Jack Daniels. Just dont let one of the Areki members find out. \n\n- J. Auburn,
    MSL"
