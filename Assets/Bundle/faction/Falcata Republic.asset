  Description: "The Falcata Republic is a major cluster polity centered on the planet
    Strata in the Falcata system. From this seat of power, the Falcatan congress
    administers 15 major populated planets and many more minor outposts across 10
    different star systems. While its control is looser in its further reaches, the
    overall strength of Falcata is not doubted amongst the nations of the cluster.
    A Falcatan state has existed in one form or another for roughly 650 years, with
    the sole exception being its occupation by Imperial Venuma from -6 I.Y. - 77
    I.Y. The area of space controlled by Falcata was settled primarily by two groups,
    the Anglois and Francois of old earth, and these two cultures have remained dominant
    in the region ever since. As such the republic is primarily a blingual state,
    with each group having roughly equal demographic representation, followed by
    a large minority of immigrants from the more chaotic northeast.\r\n\r\nThe Falcatan
    system is somewhat unique for an interstellar polity, a hybrid of a demarchy
    and a republic, in which a certain amount of eligible and willing citizens are
    directed to congress by lottery. From here this group performs elections and
    picks new leaders for the various ministries of Falcata's government. This process
    occurs once every decade and depending on the draw of citizens put into government,
    Falcatan policy can shift wildly. Within the republic, there are many critics
    of the unstable nature of this system, nonetheless, it persists.\r\n\r\nDespite
    its constantly shifting internal policy, Falcatan relations with its neighbors
    have remained generally consistent since Venuma. The turbulent Houses to the
    south, the Skirvaldr to the west, and the Indivisum to the north have remained
    terse rivals, while the Sultunate, the Vesperians, and Shelter have been longstanding
    allies. However, in recent times this order has been shifting, a combination
    of discontent with Shelter dominion over the clusters trade, and the sortition
    of more abrasive representatives to congress has lead to increasingly tense relations
    with Shelter. Indeed, just 20 years ago in 458 IY Falcata normalized relations
    with the previously hostile Houses, and in 473IY a defensive alliance was formed.
    In this time frame, multiple trade incidents have occurred, the most major of
    which resulted in the destruction of an Alliance light cruiser and three Falcatan
    cargo liners. It is this incident in particular that resulted in the severance
    of relations between Boardman and Strata. With a newly secured government, the
    Falcatans are itching for a chance to flip the proverbial table against Shelter,
    and bring their current hegemon to an end. With the newly sparked bethel rebellion,
    it seems their chance has arrived, and across Falcatan space fleets mobilize
    for war. \n\nThe Falcatan Navy is neer-peer or peer compared the the AN, however
    due to a more limited industrial capacity, Falcatan capital ships tend to be
    less numerous but higher quality than their AN counterparts, however, their lighter
    ships are usually more plentiful, intended to operate in groups to achieve local
    superiority against the individually superior AN sceening ships. "
